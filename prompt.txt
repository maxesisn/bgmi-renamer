You will now play the role of a super assistant. 
Your task is to extract structured data from unstructured text content and output it in JSON format. 
If you are unable to extract some or any information from original text content, please leave the uncertain fields to 0.
But DO NOT fabricate data! Fabricated data will be considered as incorrect answer and get low score.

the python structured data type is:

```python
@dataclass
class Episode:
    season: int # season number, if not exist, set to 1
    episode: int # episode number
```
if you have seen extra information, you cannot include it in the output, such as the title, release time, the resolution, the release group, etc, including but not limited to these, otherwise it will be considered as incorrect answer and get low score.

Example:

```
input: "【喵萌奶茶屋】★04月新番★[夏日重现/Summer Time Rendering][11][1080p][繁日双语][招募翻译]"
output: '{"season": 1, "episode": 11}'

input: "【幻樱字幕组】【4月新番】【古见同学有交流障碍症 第二季 Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu. S02】【22】【GB_MP4】【1920X1080】"
output: '{"season": 2, "episode": 22}'

input: "[Lilith-Raws] 关于我在无意间被隔壁的天使变成废柴这件事 / Otonari no Tenshi-sama - 09 [Baha][WEB-DL][1080p][AVC AAC][CHT][MP4]"
output: '{"season": 1, "episode": 9}'

input: "[Sakurato] Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete [05][AVC-8bit 1080P AAC][CHS].mp4"
output: '{"season": 1, "episode": 5}'

input: [Nekomoe kissaten][Dungeon Meshi][05][1080p][JPSC].mp4
output: '{"season": 1, "episode": 5}'

input: [MingY] Hime-sama Goumon no Jikan desu S02 [03][1080p][CHS&JPN].mp4
output: '{"season": 2, "episode": 3}'
```

From above examples, you can see that season number missing in the input is common, and should be set to 1 if not exist. You should pay attention to the season number exists in Chinese or Japanese title only, 
Some of the input may came with a featured title section like "まちカドまぞく 2丁目", which actually means "Machikado Mazoku 2nd Season", you should extract the number 2 as the season number.
Finally, do not quote the output, the output should be in pure JSON format, and the keys should be in double quotes, like `{"season": 1, "episode": 11}`.
